<h1>Editing helpdesk categories</h1>

This screen lets you administer two lists - the list
of call types, and the list of FAQ categories.  Both
of these are used in the helpdesk system - the former,
to allow the filtering of helpdesk calls.  The latter,
to allow the filtering of frequently asked questions.
