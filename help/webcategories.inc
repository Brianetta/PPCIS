<h1>Editing website and contact categories</h1>

This screen lets you administer two lists - the list
of website categories, and the list of external contact
types. <br>
<br>
The website categories list is used to allow filtering
of the website directory.  The external contact types
list is used to allow filtering of the external directory.
