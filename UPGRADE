PPCIS Version 2.0

To upgrade from the version 1 series of PPCIS
(probably 1.0 since the rest weren't widespread)
you need to execute ppcs_upgrade.sql on your
database, and copy the contents of
settings-extra.inc into your settings.inc file.

The colour system has changed; ppcis.css is
fully commented, and can be used to devise a
suitable colour scheme.  The colour variables
can be safely deleted from settings.inc if
you want to avoid clutter.
