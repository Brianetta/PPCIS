All rights reserved.\r\n# Portable PHP/MySQL Corporate Intranet System\r\n\r\n## Read INSTALL for installation instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis intranet system is divided up into modules.  These can be\r\nselectively enabled or disabled with modules.conf.  A module is\r\ndefined as any PHP file that includes head.inc at the start and\r\ntail.inc at the end.\r\n\r\nThe system will only show news articles to people who are not\r\nlogged in to the system.  The login box at the top of the page\r\ndisappears once logged in, to be replaced with a change\r\npassword button and a log out button.\r\n\r\n   The default user is admin and the password is istrator\r\n\r\n# MODULES\r\n\r\n## NEWS\r\n\r\nThe news module displays news items, in much the manner that\r\nany news site would.  News articles are submitted by users on\r\nthe system, and by default must be authorised by a news admin.\r\n\r\nOnly the ten most recent news articles are displayed in the\r\nCurrent News screen - the rest are displayed as headlines only\r\nin the Archived News screen.  Users can filter their view of\r\nthe news by topic, and if they do, the ten most recent articles\r\nunder that topic will be displayed.\r\n\r\nThe Submit New screen allows a user to compose a new article,\r\nand to preview it whenever they want.  HTML tags <i> and <b>\r\nare allowed, and carriage returns are retained as <br> tags.\r\nOnce submitted, the user cannot edit their article again unless\r\nthey are a news admin.\r\n\r\n## DIRECTORY\r\n\r\nThe internal directory lists all the users on the system that\r\nhave a directory record.  Only users can be added to this\r\ndirectory.  It can be filtered by first name and/or last name,\r\nteam and the plain-text information field.  Photographs can be\r\nuploaded if desired.\r\n\r\nThe external directory is a seperate list, for listing contact\r\ndetails of people who are not users.  It can be filtered on\r\nfirst name, last name, company and/or contact type.\r\n\r\nThe web directory is a table of web links.  It is categorised,\r\nand can be filtered on the category.  The links launch in the\r\nsame window by default.\r\n\r\n## HELPDESK\r\n\r\nThe helpdesk is intended to be able to service all types of\r\nhelpdesk call, not necesarily calls for help, but also requests\r\nfor information, or to request resources.\r\n\r\nThe manage calls screen is the default screen for users who are\r\nnot helpdesk staff.  It shows all the calls logged by the user,\r\nand allows them to click on the call number to view the details.\r\nThere are a number of filtering options, and it's possible for\r\nany user to type in the call number of any call and to view the\r\ncontents of that call.\r\n\r\nHelpdesk staff have two similar screens - Manage Calls and\r\nAssigned Calls.  They are the same, except Assigned Calls only\r\nlists calls that have been assigned to the helpdesk staff in\r\nquestion.  Also, the Managed Calls list shows calls logged by\r\nany user, and is filterable on the user.\r\n\r\nWhen a specific call is opened, the user can see the basic\r\ninformation about that call (date it was logged, the category\r\nit's in, and their initial problem).  They can also see the\r\npriority which has been assigned to it by helpdesk staff (the\r\ndefault is \"waiting\").  They can see who's been assigned to the\r\ncall, and any information which has been added since the call\r\nwas logged, in the form of \"history\".\r\n\r\nThe owner can alter the location of the call, they can add\r\ninformation of their own to the history, and they can close the\r\ncall.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, helpdesk staff can alter the owner,\r\npriority and category of any call.  They can assign helpdesk\r\nstaff the call, and can remove them.  They can also add history\r\nto any call.\r\n\r\nThere are two \"apply changes\" buttons on a calldetails screen.\r\nThey are the same, and it doesn't matter which is used.\r\n\r\nThe \"Log a new call\" screen is a simple submission form, where\r\nthe user selects a call category, a location, and describes the\r\nnature of the query as best they can.  Helpdesk staff also have\r\nthe option to choose an owner for the call; this facilitates\r\nlogging of calls by telephone or by other means.\r\n\r\nThe FAQ screen is quite similar to the News screen.  It is\r\nfilterable on category, and simple word searches are possible.\r\nUsers can also type in the number of a call to jump directly\r\nto it.  If they explicitly choose a call number, the other\r\nfilters are ignored.\r\n\r\nThe FAQ edit screen lists the FAQs, and allows helpdesk staff\r\nto modify or delete existing FAQs and to add new ones.\r\n\r\n## ADMIN\r\n\r\nThe admin module changes in appearance depending on the rights\r\nof the logged in user.\r\n\r\nA user admin has access to:\r\n   User Manager\r\n   New User\r\n   Teams and Locations\r\n\r\nA news admin has access to:\r\n   News admin\r\n   News topics\r\n\r\nA directory admin has access to:\r\n   Directory Admin\r\n   External directory admin\r\n   Teams and locations\r\n   Website admin\r\n   Website and contact categories\r\n\r\nA helpdesk staff has access to:\r\n   Helpdesk categories\r\n   Teams and Locations\r\n\r\nRegular users have access to:\r\n   Change directory\r\n   Preferences\r\n\r\nGuest users are denied access to all admin pages.\r\n\r\nThe user manager screen shows a list of all current users,\r\nfilterable on first name or last name.  There is an alphabet\r\nof links to filter on lastname initial.\r\n\r\nEach record on this screen has three options.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the user's directory details can be altered or removed.\r\nRemoving a user from the directory destroys any data that would\r\nbe available in the directory (eg, email address, telephone\r\nnumbers) but does not destroy the user's real name.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the user's rights can be altered.  Changes to the\r\nrights must be saved.  At least one user on the system should\r\nhave user admin rights and the right to log in.  There are no\r\nspecial privileges available to the default user \"admin\".\r\n\r\nThirdly, the user's password can be changed.  Note that on this\r\nscreen, the user's username can be changed at the same time.\r\nBlank passwords are accepted.  You can't change a user's\r\nusername without changing their password, although this will\r\nbe altered in a future release.\r\n\r\nFourthly, the user can be deleted.  This takes you to a\r\nconfirmation screen.  Clicking delete again on the confirmation\r\nscreen will remove the user's record, their rights record and\r\ntheir directory record.  Be warned, removing a user will cause\r\ntheir name to vanish from news articles and helpdesk calls that\r\nthey have submitted.  You might want to just disable their login\r\nright for a time, if they have current news articles or calls.\r\n\r\nThe new user screen allows new users to be created.  Giving a\r\nreal name or a password isn't absolutely necessary, but not\r\nhaving a name can make some screens look a little untidy.  If\r\na password is entered, it must be entered twice to ensure that\r\nthere is no typographical error.\r\n\r\nThe Teams and Locations screen allows teams and locations to be\r\nadded, renamed and removed.  There is no confirmation on this\r\nscreen, so beware when removing items.  If you remove, for example,\r\na team, and then add another with the same name, the users who\r\nwere in that team will not be in the new one until you change them\r\nall individually.\r\n\r\nThe directory admin screen is the same as the user manager screen,\r\nexcept that only the directory modification option is available.\r\n\r\nThe external directory admin screen lists all the contacts in the\r\nexternal directory.  It is filterable on name or company.  New\r\nrecords can be added, and existing records added or removed.  The\r\ninterface is a very simplistic form.  In the future, there will\r\nalso be a category list, and external contacts will be able to\r\nbe assigned to a category for better filtering.\r\n\r\nThe website admin page allows you to add, edit and remove the web\r\nlinks in the website directory.  You can only alter one at a time;\r\nattempting to alter more will result in only one record being\r\nchanged (the one with the update button that was clicked).\r\n\r\nThe Website and Contact Categories screen allows website categories\r\nand contact types to be added, renamed and removed.  There is no\r\nconfirmation on this screen, so beware when removing items.  If you\r\nremove, for example, a category, and then add another with the same\r\nname, the sites that were in that category will not be in the new\r\none until you change them all individually.\r\n\r\nThe News Admin screen allows news admins to review all of the news\r\narticles that have been submitted to the system.  Articles awaiting\r\nauthorisation have the submitter's name enclosed in square brackets\r\nand made italic.  By clicking DETAILS the news admin can review,\r\nedit, preview, delete and authorise news articles.  The HTML tags\r\n<i> and <b> are allowed.  Carriage returns are retained as <br>\r\ntags.\r\n\r\nThe News Topics screen allows news topics to be added, renamed and\r\nremoved.  There is no confirmation on this screen, so beware when\r\nremoving items.  If you remove, for example, a topic, and then add\r\nanother with the same name, the articles that were in that topic\r\nwill not be in the new one until you change them all individually.\r\n\r\nThe Helpdesk Categories screen allows call types and faq categories\r\nto be added, renamed and removed.  There is no confirmation on this\r\nscreen, so beware when removing items.  If you remove, for example,\r\na call category, and then add another with the same name, the\r\nhelpdesk calls that were in that category will not be in the new\r\none until you change them all individually.\r\n\r\n## LIBRARY\r\n\r\nThe library is a file storage system.  Files are stored in folders,\r\nwhich are arranged hierarchically.  Files admin always have an\r\nupload form for adding new files, and can make new folders or adjust\r\nthe current ones.\r\n\r\nEach file in a folder is listed as a row in a table.  The download\r\noption attempts to send the file to the client (using a mime type of\r\n*/*).  This works for many files, but there are exceptions - Windows\r\nusers with Office will find that Word files will be opened in Word\r\nregardless.  This option is not shown if a user does not have access\r\nto this file.\r\n\r\nThe open option starts the file in a new browser window, and sends\r\nthe mimetype that was originally sent by the browser that uploaded\r\nthe file.  When using proprietary file types, such as MS Office\r\nfiles, it's a good idea to make sure that files are uploaded from a\r\nmachine that has the application installed, so that the mime type is\r\ncorrectly set.  This option is not shown is a user does not have\r\naccess to this file.\r\n\r\nThe details option shows the file's details, including which teams\r\nhave access to the file, if it's secured, and the description. Files\r\nadmin users can alter the description, the security details and the\r\nmime type, as well as which folder the file is in.\r\n\r\nThe security on files is team based.  If there are no teams listed,\r\nthe file is open to all and can be downloaded by any user.  If there\r\nare teams listed, then the file can only be downloaded by logged in\r\nmembers of those teams.  The security can only be adjusted by files\r\nadmin users, so it's important to be aware that they must be trusted.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the screen are two zoom buttons, where users can type\r\nin the unique number of any file or folder, and be taken straight to\r\nits info screen.  Each folder and file info screen has its unique\r\nnumber displayed on it.\r\n\r\n## ONLINE HELP\r\n\r\nClicking Online Help when in a module with a help file brings up a HTML\r\nbased page describing what everything on that screen does.  It's\r\ncontext sensitive.\r\n\r\nAll questions and comments can be emailed to the author, Brian Ronald:\r\n   brian@ppcis.org\r\n\r\nThe latest version (and my public gpg key) should be available from:\r\n   http://www.ppcis.org/\r\n",
